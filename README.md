# API for Digital Transformation open data repository
The European Commission's DG CONNECT together with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) launched, in 2018, the "APIs4DGov - Digital Government APIs. The Road to value-added Open-driven services." study with the purpose to gain further understanding of the current use of APIs in digital government and their added value for public services.
This project lasted two years and has followed by the API4IPS (API for Innovative Public Services) project, within the IPS action of the ISA2 programme, done in collaboration with the European Commission DIGIT and CNECT DGs.

The collection contains observations and datasets that have used to support the studies (related, for example, to API communities, API standards and governmental APIs). Notice that these datasets are maintained and published only for information purposes. For this reason, they will be updated following the timeline of the study and it is not guaranteed they will be further updated after the end of the studies. Should you have any update or comment on the datasets, please contact us at: jrc-apis4dgov@ec.europa.eu.
